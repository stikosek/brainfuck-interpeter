# Brainfuck interpeter

This is a simpel brainfuck interpeter written in rust.
It has 2 modes, classic (default) and visualised.

## Usage

```sh
brainfuck-interpeter <filename> <mode>
```
You can leave out mode, it defaults to `classic`.
You can also put `visualised` there to get a live memory map and slowed down execution
